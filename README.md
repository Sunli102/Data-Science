# Data-Science

Data Preprocessing is implemented in the first project, which includes generation of Data Quality Report, Equal-Width and Equal-Frequency binning, Pairwise Analysis with SPLOM, outlier identification and clamp transformatin, feature scaling wiht normalization and standardization

In the Predictive Data Analytics project, machine learning algorithms are performed on a cancer dataset. Classification accuracy is compared on the performance of Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest and Logistic Regression classifers. 

In the project of Classification and Prediction on Genetic Data, different Machine Learning Algorithms on genetic datasets with feature numbers up to 9000. The best classfiers are selected and applied to execute prediciton or classification. Furthermore, Multi-label (14 target labels) classifications were implemented on a dataset with 103 features.
