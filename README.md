# Data-Science

Data Preprocessing is implemented in the first project, which includes generation of Data Quality Report, Equal-Width and Equal-Frequency binning, Pairwise Analysis with SPLOM, outlier identification and clamp transformatin, feature scaling wiht normalization and standardization

In the Predictive Data Analytics project, machine learning algorithms are performed on a cancer dataset. Classification accuracy is compared on the performance of Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest and Logistic Regression classifers.
